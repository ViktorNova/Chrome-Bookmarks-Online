Chrome Bookmarks Online
=======================


This project allows you to have an online copy of your Google Chrome bookmarks.
You just need a regular Dropbox account for accessing bookmarks page through a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) public folder.

Installation
------------
* [Download](https://github.com/gornostal/Chrome-Bookmarks-Online/zipball/master) or clone the project.
* Under the Dropbox public folder create a `bookmarks` folder and put these files in there
* Create in your OS new task in a task scheduler for copying `Bookmarks` file to the Dropbox folder. For Windows users this file is located in `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Bookmarks`, for Linux users â€” `/home/<Username>/.config/google-chrome/Default/Bookmarks` (don't make symbolic links for Dropbox, because it not syncing them properly)
* Access your bookmarks from URL: `http://dl.dropbox.com/u/<DopboxID>/bookmarks/index.html`
* If you hav no public folder try `http://dockbox.io`
* This fork suppports encryption of the bookmark file, encrypt it with openssl:
```
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in Bookmarks -out Bookmarks.enc -pass pass:"YOUR PASSWORD" -e -base64
```
* Under linux you can use this crontab entry to automate the syncing:
```
0 * * * *  openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in $HOME/.config/chromium/Default/Bookmarks -out $HOME/Dropbox/janosch.dockbox/Bookmarks.enc -pass pass:"YOUR PASSWORD" -e -base64
```
Configuration
-------------
You can enable (or disable) favicons by setting `loadFavicons` to `true` (or `false`) in file `index.html` at `line 15`. Without favicons page loads much faster.


P.S.

Will be glad to get any advice on how to improve the project.
